  "body": "# General information\r\nVladimir Gorshenin\r\nMay 19, 1984\r\n\r\n# Education\r\nMy whole education at each stage was related to math, physics and informatics. I participated in number of different competitions in school and university. Both of them I graduated with honour!\r\n\r\n## Chelyabinsk State University\r\n* Dates: 2001 - 2007\r\n* Faculty, Dept: Math, Computer Security and Applied Algebra\r\n* Major: Computer Security, MSc\r\n* Grade: excellent\r\n* Address: Chelyabinsk State University / Kashirinikh Street, 129 / 454136, Chelyabinsk, Russia\r\n* Info: [www.csu.ru] (http://www.csu.ru/en)\r\n\r\n# Professional Experience\r\nStarted working at the of 14 as the junior network administrator in school computer class. Then I tried myself in different jobs resulting in two directions that I really keen on: teaching, R&D. Also \"computer security\" - which was my major in the university - gave me not the set of skills (like shellcodes, pentests, etc), but strong ability to think \"out of the box\".\r\n\r\nMy motto is \"work for challenge\". I'm convinced that \"work for money\" or \"work for knowledge\" - are obsolete nowadays. Only a real challenge would attract talented professionals capable to learn new knowledge, develop new skills and finally solve the challenge.\r\n\r\n## Research and Development Team Leader\r\n* Dates: June, 2014 â€” August, 2016\r\n* Main activities: \r\n    - **Development of algorithms** for image search: graphical search requests, similarity search, duplicate images detection, face recognition and classification, applying popularity ranking to Sphinx search engine\r\n    - **Sales optimization** of digital content: using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to increase profits in digital content sales\r\n    - **Talent management**: acquisition high-talented employees and trainees through dedicated activity (like MLSchool and CVSchool *- see later*) and further development of them by investing time, knowledge and mentoring\r\n* Address: PressFoto / Office 501 / Truda Street, 82A / 454091, Chelyabinsk, Russia\r\n* info: [www.pressfoto.com](http://www.pressfoto.com), [www.everypixel.com](http://wwww.everypixel.com)",
